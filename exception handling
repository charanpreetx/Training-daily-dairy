# Exception: Exception are nothing but errors.
# We can say that exception is an unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program.

# a=int(input("Enter number:"))   # ValueError

# y=5/0
# print(y)    # ZeroDivisionError

# print("Hello")

# # To overcome these type of errors we use Exception handling.
# # In following code if there is error it will not show error just show statement which we wrote.

# # try and except.
# try:
#     a=int(input("Enter number: "))
# except:
#     print("There is some error.")

# print("Above program is about try and except.")

# # try, except and Else
# try:
#     a=int(input("Enter number first: "))
#     b=int(input("Enter number second: "))
# except:
#     print("There is some error.")    # It will execute only if there is error in our program.
# else:
#     print("Result:", a+b)    # It will execute only of our program have no error.

# print("Above program is about try, except and else.")

# try, except, else and finally.
