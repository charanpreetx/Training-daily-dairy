# File handling: It is an important part of any web application.
# We can create, read, write, update and delete files.

# open(): takes two arguments(filename and mode)
# Mode
# r "read"
# w "write"
# a "append"
# x "create"

# Read 
f=open("batchD.txt","x")

# # Write in batchD.txt.
f=open("batchD.txt","w")
f.write("Hi this is my created file.")

# Update batchD.txt.
f=open("batchD.txt","a")
f.write("\nHello batch D")

# Read batchD.txt.
f=open("batchD.txt",'r')
print(f.read())

# Read batchD.txt.
f=open("batchD.txt",'r')
print(f.read(10))

# # # Delete file.

# To delete file we need to import OS module.
import os

if os.path.exists("batchD.txt"):
    os.remove("batchD.txt")
    print("your file is deleted successfully.")
else:
    print("your file does not exist.")
